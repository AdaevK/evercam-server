# Evercam Media

Evercam Media is the component that is responsible for talking  to the camera. Consider it as a "proxy" for all commands. Processes here request either snapshots or streams and then send them to the API, Storage, or to any of the clients (e.g. Evercam-Dashboard, Evercam-Play-Android, Evercam-Play-iOS).
