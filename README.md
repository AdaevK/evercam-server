# Evercam Server [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Deps Status][hex-image]][hex-url]

Evercam Server is the component that is responsible for talking  to the camera. Consider it as a "proxy" for all commands. Processes here request either snapshots or streams and then send them to storage, or to any of the clients (e.g. Evercam-Dashboard, Evercam-Android, Evercam-iOS).
